# MyGallery

## Start my own business to sell my photos
By profession a software engineer and incidentally a photographer, I have traveled across international modern cities, small towns, vast wilderness, mountains, forests and lakes, telling storyies about different cultures, historical buildings, and the beauty of nature.

In this gallery, you will explore the exhibition of exclusively selected photos that I have taken in the last few year. If you fell in love with one of them, do not hesitate and just buy it!

## Technology Used
